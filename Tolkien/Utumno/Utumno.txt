Utumno
by: David Franklin

Beyond the northernmost regions which test our understanding...
Rose Utumno atop a lonely mountain cut headless by a great sword of ice
Glaciers ruined the land and laid bare molten wounds of the Underworld
Heaving upwards -- a throne of rock to reign above the middle earth below
And whereupon this constructed wonder may observe the song of Illuin
For all its radiance -- That Spire proclaimed curiosity treason! 
And breached the clouds with besieging light
Percussion crashed upon embattled walls made powerful by calculation
Indeed, fortifications actually made the maelstrom concert 
Triumphant towers merely mocked the old Lamp with counter melody
Fortress gates, engraved with terrors -- opened with smiling teeth
Voices whispered to mortal guests, beckoning entrance to the citadel
So that many, may discover the Dark Lord’s grand experiment

Truly, what singing could rival the subtle harmony of running water? 
Falling on lush gardened angles, spiraled over gold palatial depths
In halls adorned by black banners, flowed red fountains and splendor
Trees and meadows flourished in the mouth of these heated caverns
Vaulted ceilings, flowering in mosaic nourished from the... warmth -- of Arda’s music
Stairs, exquisite symmetry descending the erupting chasm, carved from echoed chorus
Ring the desperate hammer strokes of Grond -- crafted, the smith’s tool
Written texts, wealth enough to rule them all. Artistry forged by intentioned thought
Libraries,  learning not forbidden -- free before the endless sea of fire
Corruption? For seeking knowledge? -- why is that fire even made secret?
How methodical -- these children of Iluvatar walked into the fissures, willingly
Drums led the dance, while burning beasts chanted a new hymn of creation
Indeed, the Dark Enemy shall pass: “Arise! Imperishable flames of Udun.”
