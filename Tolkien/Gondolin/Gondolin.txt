Gondolin 
by: David Franklin

Far too long have recurrent nightmares called for your return  
There and back again, to where restless visions of fire reign
When ambition’s madness went unchallenged, luring many into the abyss with lies
You were there, when a free people’s strength failed in union with oaths of blasphemy
Beasts, ash, and the burning crack of whips -- all were unleashed from the iron fortress
Fellowship broke in a dreadful ring, forever shattering the sharpness of your ears 
And here you remain, burdened by memory, just -- surviving in sleepless quarters
Whispering rains besiege you, bidding you awaken, reminding you of duty
The sky’s unnumbered tears cannot wash away, what can never fully heal 
Other soldiers will not join your patrol, for few now live to protect this realm...

Some grey figure wanders in crooked stillness, conjuring voiceless cries in the mists
A wingless serpent scratches tales into its cursed seat with fluttering blades of black 
“Where is it? Where is it?” this creature demands unseen burglars play a game of riddles
”Lost! ” these endless screams and inane babble are no gift to the foes of Melkor	
An archer perched among rocks, could easily silence shrieks which serve the Enemy
”Elves!” the Dark Lord’s hissing wyrm strikes with words “Stupid Wicked Elves!”
Mouthless it mutters “Gondolin, Gondolin” and the tension of your bow becomes painful	
Your aim falters out of pity for its sad begging, “Will you not hear me in your high halls!?”
Wind answers with piercing arrow, bursting feathered clouds above this homeless man
Noble birds cannot see all ends -- only precious things steep cliffs hide in their pocket

Laughter -- heavy, rumbling, this new mockery tears and rends the chasm from within
Eagles refuse those terrible bells of Angband and turn their gaze from Northern sands
Rising dust wails and gasps, three mountains erupt in sudden thunderous chants
Sacrificing one’s very hand shall never truly escape jagged chains of ice and thorns
Cascading glaciers scarred with craters welcome more challenges for single combat
Two ruined trees heed a fair maiden’s song and pile those slain for jeweled radiance
Watchful peaks crowned by golden flowers can no longer keep safe the land’s secrets
Like many who see such times, it is not for you to decide the part your faults have to play
Moonlight, it rivens arched gates in stone, now speak friend, and enter the Door of Night
Gondolin’s trumpets are silent, one does not simply walk into the last great Elven city

Lush sanctuaries of water mirror works of illumination that tower into the evening
As this citadel, domed with wonders, shares itself only with the Queen of all the Stars
Yet, she wearies of flaunted treasures -- and notices you drifting in the streets, alone
Unexpected daggers sting you -- no… someone pulls you from the timeless depths
”Please, help, I’m lost” weeps a frightened little one, steel ringed with fine mail of silver
Storms are coming, and no one should sail alone, not even the wisest of Mariners 
Put aside your feelings, this Half Elven child armed in the city’s defense, is crying
Bravely smile, and always steer West when all other lights go out -- or so you claim
There are horizons far more bright and vast than a life spent following orders -- look
See, the Princess grins playfully as you laugh with her small castaway, she says: 
	
“Thanks Glorfindel”
	
Palatial gardens tire imposing guards who salute your jokes and offered flask of wine
Striding past you is a Mortal wearing wings -- more warnings reforged in broken revelry
The king in yellow stewards a lavish feast at late hours his Nephew chooses to appear
Wrapped in scales of grim violet, cold becomes the pale Princess with each advance
Always, ever the sharp glances, this wraith touches his prey with witless flattery
Courts of glass hear each vile utterance and believe the lies, “A just question my lady”
“Glorfindel is captain in name only”, his forked tongue provokes you by caressing her
But, music is forsaken for madness when a Friend takes orders from the Dark Elf’s son
Atop this spire he hurls poison, “Drink slows his mind”, and turns like you are nothing
That sentry grows tall with spiked helmet and casts you out for the courage to stand up
	
“As you wish, I care not”

Minor things you must let go because the beating drums of terror have finally come...
Arrows cut down the Orcs, Morgoth’s Balrogs raise their whips in defiance of the Elves
Their Prince rides out on a Dragon to meet the city’s ascending might with fiery singing
Monuments in the markets are dragged down by writhing, molten limbs of metal
Crashing spears are breathed in waves by a Red Drake until the Mortal’s low strike
Shield walls clash with hatred’s axe -- and into the square leaps that Fool of a Friend
Relentless Trolls march forward and push their own master with disciplined maneuver
The Fountain rids us of the Lord of Demons after falling upon a slumped spiked helmet
Libraries are destroyed -- the crumbling artistry of scribes collapses in burning pyres
Overwhelming cries beneath smoldering rubble take hold of your trembling hands
  
Wolves howl -- you can still carry the injured even if you can barely hold a weapon
Gondolin’s people rally to their captain leading survivors behind the last defenses
One last time you are glimpsed by the Princess while the Mortal shows their Secret Way
Everyone takes flight into the long dark tunnel that opens ahead beneath the cleft eyries
The Hill cracks in the doomed valley below a Demon crouched unaware in the rocks
Staring out over forested plains flooded by flame, but then it jumps at sound, startled
Quickly! There is no other choice, the Fiend sets its lash on women and children
This Foe in the maelstrom is not beyond you, thrust at the monster’s crescent horns
Weakness in its belly is revealed by Secret Fire glowing blue within your killing sword
Desperation, you still see the pitiful eyes, and remember shouting during the struggle:

“You shall not pass” 

Shadow claims every thought -- light rushes into memory, brighter than any in the world
But it was only the passing tides that reflect a swift sunrise that carried you here...
From the highest peaks to the lowest pit, you fell with the Balrog of Morgoth
Until talons and great beaks smote the Dark Lord’s host upon the mountainside
A soaring choir of white feathers came when it really mattered after so much happened
For the Bald Thorondor raised wings brown as the woodlands and lifted you from death
”Fly you fools!” screamed the King of the Eagles at those who witnessed your sacrifice...
...At long last -- A Mariner sailed from the West bearing the Evenstar across the heavens
Gondolin and lands sundered by the seas have fallen out of knowledge into ages past
There is an offer -- Melkor’s servant, Sauron claims realms diminished by wars of wrath
	
“Well met Olorin, I am glad and grateful that you have been my friend during all of this”
“But I have no desire to hold a sword again”

The road goes ever on and on Glorfindel, why do you linger in these Halls of the Dead?
Life can be within you again -- Forgive me... Alas, these grey robes and old age...
Maybe I seem wise but your wounds surpass my cheap tricks or skills at healing
The rights of the powerful I have not, so I can only ask of you to join me in this task
Good may exist beyond the will of evil and perhaps it is well worth fighting for 
But arms cannot be taken up nor may we directly intervene in the lives of others
Honestly, what can we any of us do aside from everyday acts of small ordinary folk?
Please, you understand compassion better than I -- help us learn from past mistakes
Dawn comes, a ship waits for me, soon I journey into the East, towards Middle Earth
Should we meet again, may it be in a simpler place, of rivers, green trees, and sunlight
