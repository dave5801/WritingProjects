The Dark Lord during these ages of Middle Earth is not Sauron but Melkor, or Morgoth. 

Utumno - Melkor's first fortress in which he created a plethora of evil creatures in Middle Earth.

Angband - Melkor, now named Morgoth, used this fortress to stage a war against the Noldor Elves.

Gondolin - the hidden city of the Noldor, that was betrayed to Morgoth, and utterly destroyed. It is referenced in the Hobbit.
