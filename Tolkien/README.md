# Tolkien Fanfiction

These are narrative poems in closely related to Milton's Paradise lost, or Dante's Inferno. It is an attempt to explore regions or events as described in Tolkien's Silmarillion, a fascinating work of fantasy world building that serves as a backstory to Lord of the Rings. 

Each of these directories contains poems that describe locations, events, or characters. Each my own personal interpretation. 

Full disclosure: I had never read The Silmarillion prior to these works. This is in keeping with the idea, that the best way to learn something, is to teach something. And I learned a great deal from these narratives.
