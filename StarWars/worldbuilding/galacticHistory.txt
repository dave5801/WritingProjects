Of the Force and the Early Galaxy

Each variation of civilization has its own measure of time. In this case the units of meaurement 
are reflected in the calender of a forgotten world. However periods of life will range beyond what
is considered natural.

These are the events of a history long ago, in a galaxy far, far away.

In over what is believed over a million years ago, civilization reigned across the galaxy. The origin 
of this society is unknown, what worlds it ruled, or how long ago.science and technology were dominant in the 
stars -- but a series of cataclysms resulted in descent of a new galatctic dark age. 

Trade, Learning, and Communication collapsed. However, there were a few who did what they could to preserve 
civilization. To those ignorant, science and technology would seem magical. In time, knowledge became a Universal 
sign of Force There were many who dedicated their lives to this pursuit known as Force Practioners.

Of the Sith

Many Force Practitioners rose to prominence during this terrible time period. Their understanding of 
historic knowledge gave them power over the ignorant.  In time, they coalesced into many religious orders
of varying belief systems. They consolidated political control over what was previously, anarchy.
 -- they became military and political leaders in an era of barbarism and chaos. 

 In time these factions arose in the first in a series of galactic empires. The Sith arose as a dominant faction.
 They gained prominence by accepting all to join their ranks.
