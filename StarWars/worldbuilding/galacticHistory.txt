Of the Force and the Early Galaxy

Each variation of civilization has its own measure of time. In this case the units of meaurement 
are reflected in the calender of a forgotten world. However periods of life will range beyond what
is considered natural.

These are the events of a history long ago, in a galaxy far, far away.

Once long ago, civilization reigned across many solar systems in the galaxy over millions of 
years. It is unknown what form this society took, or where it came from, or how many worlds
belonged to it -- but its level of scientific and technological understanding was greater 
than any that succeeded it. No one knows how, but ultimately this galactic order fell into decline. Civil war,
disaster, and a new dark age descended on the galaxy.

But all was not lost. There were those, however few in number, who preserved what they could 
accumulated of this forgotten civilization. To those ignorant of scientific research these remnant 
technologies or processes would have seemed magical. In time, it became seen as a Universal 
and Spiritual Force. Those dedicated their lives, to what was assuredly academic study, became 
known as Force practitioners 

Of the Sith

Many Force Practitioners rose to prominence during this terrible time period. Their understanding of 
historic knowledge gave them power over the ignorant.  In time, they coalesced into many religious orders
of varying belief systems. They consolidated political control over what was previously, anarchy.
 -- they became military and political leaders in an era of barbarism and chaos. 

 In time these factions arose in the first in a series of galactic empires. The Sith arose as a dominant faction.
 They gained prominence by accepting all to join their ranks.
