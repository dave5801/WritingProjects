Of the Force and the Early Galaxy

Time varies in perception with each civilization. Life ranges beyond inhabitants whose understanding is limited 
by the imposed measurement of their forgotten world. This is the history of those events long ago, in a galaxy, far, far away...

Millions of years in the past, a scientific people of unknown origin unified the stars. It was an age no longer remembered 
and only fragmented recordings remain of this distant period. The relics that remain retain their power even as economics, 
communication, and learning to succumb to cataclysm. To learn these powers of ancient knowledge became a universal sign of force to 
those struggling to survive a descending dark age. These Force practitioners restored order, and consolidated political control. 

Of the Sith

Planets that were habitable were few in number. The ancient knowledge required to make these hostile worlds paradise were left in the
hands of the few educated survivors of chaos and anarchy. Even the most mundane medicine seemed miraculous. Their control of even basic
scientific principles seemed magical. The ignorant easily fell under the sway engineered power of these masters of technology, as they 
were most dependent. Barbarism coalesced into military control in the hands of these prominent Force Practitioners.They became known as 
the Sith in a language now lost, spoken by a people no longer remembered.

They began as one faction among many different philosophies and beliefs. Great appeal was obtained allowing anyone unafraid of emotions
most closely related to survival instinct. Their numbers grew substantially. The Sith crafted weapons on the Force referred to as 
'light sabers' and established the first in a series of Galactic Empires.
