Of the Force and the Early Galaxy

Each civilization varies in its measurement of time. So shall it be measured in accordance with the 
calendar of a forgotten world. Yet life and events of a history long ago, in a galaxy, far, far away, will range far beyond the comprehension
of any of its inhabitants

These are the events of a history long ago, in a galaxy far, far away.

In over what is believed over a million years ago, civilization reigned across the galaxy. The origin 
of this society is unknown, what worlds it ruled, or how long ago.science and technology were dominant in the 
stars -- but a series of cataclysms resulted in descent of a new galatctic dark age. 

Trade, Learning, and Communication collapsed. However, there were a few who did what they could to preserve 
civilization. To those ignorant, science and technology would seem magical. In time, knowledge became a Universal 
sign of Force There were many who dedicated their lives to this pursuit known as Force Practioners.

The age witnessed their coalescence into various orders of different belief systems. Political control was established
in what was previously anarchy. One faction above all, became the military leaders in era of barbarism and chaos.

The Sith gained the majority of followers that maintained great appeal. They believed that emotion and passion are the 
critical into understanding the Force. They crafted weapons of the Force referred to as 'light sabers'. The Sith 
established the first in a series of Galactic Empires.
