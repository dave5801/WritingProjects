Of the Force and the Early Galaxy

Time varies in perception with each unique civilization. Life may range beyond the understanding of those
inhabitants of a forgotten world whose calender is used a common standard of measurement. This is the history of events 
long ago, in a galaxy, far, far away...

Millions of years ago, civilization reigned in unity across the stars. A scientific people of unknown origin ruled 
worlds innumerable. Until Economics, Learning, and Communication collapsed in a series of cataclysms. A new dark age 
descended upon their galactic empire. Knowledge of ancients became a universal sign of Force. Technology would seem 
magical to the ignorant struggling to survive in chaos.

Millions of years are but an instant to peoples of science and unknown origin that ruled innumerable stars. Laws of 
physics compelled these systems of economics, communication, and learning to succumb to disorder. To learn these powers 
of ancient knowledge became a universal sign of force to those struggling to survive a descending dark age. These Force 
practitioners restored order, and consolidated political control. 

Of the Sith

#The ignorant easily fell under the sway engineered power of these masters of technology

#Even the most mundane medicine seemed miraculous 

Historic knowledge granted power and prominence of many Force Practioners over the ignorant curing this time period.
The age witnessed their coalescence into various orders of different belief systems. Political control was established
in what was previously anarchy. One faction above all, became the military leaders in era of barbarism and chaos.

The Sith gained the majority of followers that maintained great appeal. They believed that emotion and passion are the 
critical into understanding the Force. They crafted weapons of the Force referred to as 'light sabers'. The Sith 
established the first in a series of Galactic Empires.
