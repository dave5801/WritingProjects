Of the Force and the Early Galaxy

Timeâ€™s measurement varies with each unique civilization. In this case, the units of measurement 
used to describe the people and events will reflect that of any potential readers. However, the
time periods will range beyond what is understood as a natural human lifespan.

Now as propsed, these are the events of a history long ago, in a galaxy far, far away.

Once long ago, civilization reigned across many solar systems in the galaxy over millions of 
years. It is unknown what form this society took, or where it came from, or how many worlds
belonged to it -- but its level of scientific and technological understanding was greater 
than any that succeeded it. No one knows how, but ultimately this galactic order fell into decline. Civil war,
disaster, and a new dark age descended on the galaxy.

But all was not lost. There were those, however few in number, who preserved what they could 
accumulated of this forgotten civilization. To those ignorant of scientific research these remnant 
technologies or processes would have seemed magical. In time, it became seen as a Universal 
and Spiritual Force. Those dedicated their lives, to what was assuredly academic study, became 
known as Force practitioners -- they were seen as leaders and pillars of wisdom in an era of 
barbarism and chaos.

Of the Sith

Many Force Practitioners rose to prominence during this terrible time period. Their understanding of 
historic knowledge gave them power over the ignorant.  In time, they coalesced into many religious orders
of varying belief systems. They consolidated political control over what was previously, anarchy.
