Of the Force and the Early Galaxy

Each civilization varies in its measurement of time. So shall it be counted in accordance with the calendar of a
forgotten world. Yet, life and events of a history long ago, in a galaxy, far, far away, will range far beyond the 
comprehension of any of its inhabitants.

Millions of years ago, civilization reigned in unity across the stars. A scientific people of unknown origin ruled 
worlds innumerable. Until Economics, Learning, and Communication collapsed in a series of cataclysms. A new dark age 
descended upon their galactic empire. Knowledge of ancients became a universal sign of Force. Technology would seem 
magical to the ignorant struggling to survive in chaos.

These Force practitioners restored order, and consolidated political control. 

Of the Sith

Historic knowledge granted power and prominence of many Force Practioners over the ignorant curing this time period.
The age witnessed their coalescence into various orders of different belief systems. Political control was established
in what was previously anarchy. One faction above all, became the military leaders in era of barbarism and chaos.

The Sith gained the majority of followers that maintained great appeal. They believed that emotion and passion are the 
critical into understanding the Force. They crafted weapons of the Force referred to as 'light sabers'. The Sith 
established the first in a series of Galactic Empires.
