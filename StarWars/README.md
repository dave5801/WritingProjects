# Star Wars

This is the initial stages of a worldbuilding project that reflects an alternate history of the Star Wars Universe. This explores the concept of historical revisionism. 

The justification for this, is that Star Wars, from the opening title crawl, is presented in a format that resembles documentary or political propoganda. I am wondering if it is possible that the events as described in cinema, are in fact, only one side of a more comprehensive version of fictional history.
