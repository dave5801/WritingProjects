# WritingProjects

This Repository is for my writing projects, which as of right now, are fanfiction. The purpose is to test my skills as a writer and explore narrative as a critical piece of the learning process. My goal with this repository, is to use the act of storytelling to learn for myself and better myself as an Engineer.
