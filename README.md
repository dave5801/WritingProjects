# WritingProjects

This Repository is for my writing projects, which as of right now, are fanfiction. These projects, are most assuredly, not attempt to make any money -- as they explore characters and worlds that are not mine.

The purpose is to test my skills as a writer and explore narrative as a critical piece of the learning process. My goal with this repository, is to use the act of storytelling to learn for myself and better myself as an Engineer.

Anyway, if anyone should by chance happen to stumble upon them, I hope you enjoy, I worked very hard on them.
